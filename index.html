  <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Draigan, a fullstack developer. 
        I work with React on the frontend and Node, Python, and SQL on the backend, 
        and Iâ€™ve built up experience across a wide range of technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about building clean, reliable fullstack apps, and I also 
        enjoy experimenting with AI, RAG systems, and automation. I've created secure fullstack
        apps, and I'm persistent when it comes to solving technical challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself somewhere between junior and mid level. 
      </p>
